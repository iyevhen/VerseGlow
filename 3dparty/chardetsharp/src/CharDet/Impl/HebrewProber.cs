	/// <remarks>
	///     ** General ideas of the Hebrew charset recognition **
	///     Four main charsets exist in Hebrew:
	///     "ISO-8859-8" - Visual Hebrew
	///     "windows-1255" - Logical Hebrew
	///     "ISO-8859-8-I" - Logical Hebrew
	///     "x-mac-hebrew" - ?? Logical Hebrew ??
	///     Both "ISO" charsets use a completely identical set of code points, whereas
	///     "windows-1255" and "x-mac-hebrew" are two different proper supersets of
	///     these code points. windows-1255 defines additional characters in the range
	///     0x80-0x9F as some misc punctuation marks as well as some Hebrew-specific
	///     diacritics and additional 'Yiddish' ligature letters in the range 0xc0-0xd6.
	///     x-mac-hebrew defines similar additional code points but with a different
	///     mapping.
	///     As far as an average Hebrew text with no diacritics is concerned, all four
	///     charsets are identical with respect to code points. Meaning that for the
	///     main Hebrew alphabet, all four map the same values to all 27 Hebrew letters
	///     (including final letters).
	///     The dominant difference between these charsets is their directionality.
	///     "Visual" directionality means that the text is ordered as if the renderer is
	///     not aware of a BIDI rendering algorithm. The renderer sees the text and
	///     draws it from left to right. The text itself when ordered naturally is read
	///     backwards. A buffer of Visual Hebrew generally looks like so:
	///     "[last word of first line spelled backwards] [whole line ordered backwards
	///     and spelled backwards] [first word of first line spelled backwards]
	///     [end of line] [last word of second line] ... etc' "
	///     adding punctuation marks, numbers and English text to visual text is
	///     naturally also "visual" and from left to right.
	///     "Logical" directionality means the text is ordered "naturally" according to
	///     the order it is read. It is the responsibility of the renderer to display
	///     the text from right to left. A BIDI algorithm is used to place general
	///     punctuation marks, numbers and English text in the text.
	///     Texts in x-mac-hebrew are almost impossible to find on the Internet. From
	///     what little evidence I could find, it seems that its general directionality
	///     is Logical.
	///     To sum up all of the above, the Hebrew probing mechanism knows about two
	///     charsets:
	///     Visual Hebrew - "ISO-8859-8" - backwards text - Words and sentences are
	///     backwards while line order is natural. For charset recognition purposes
	///     the line order is unimportant (In fact, for this implementation, even
	///     word order is unimportant).
	///     Logical Hebrew - "windows-1255" - normal, naturally ordered text.
	///     "ISO-8859-8-I" is a subset of windows-1255 and doesn't need to be
	///     specifically identified.
	///     "x-mac-hebrew" is also identified as windows-1255. A text in x-mac-hebrew
	///     that contain special punctuation marks or diacritics is displayed with
	///     some unconverted characters showing as question marks. This problem might
	///     be corrected using another model prober for x-mac-hebrew. Due to the fact
	///     that x-mac-hebrew texts are so rare, writing another model prober isn't
	///     worth the effort and performance hit.
	///     *** The Prober ***
	///     The prober is divided between two nsSBCharSetProbers and an nsHebrewProber,
	///     all of which are managed, created, fed data, inquired and deleted by the
	///     nsSBCSGroupProber. The two nsSBCharSetProbers identify that the text is in
	///     fact some kind of Hebrew, Logical or Visual. The final decision about which
	///     one is it is made by the nsHebrewProber by combining final-letter scores
	///     with the scores of the two nsSBCharSetProbers to produce a final answer.
	///     The nsSBCSGroupProber is responsible for stripping the original text of HTML
	///     tags, English characters, numbers, low-ASCII punctuation characters, spaces
	///     and new lines. It reduces any sequence of such characters to a single space.
	///     The buffer fed to each prober in the SBCS group prober is pure text in
	///     high-ASCII.
	///     The two nsSBCharSetProbers (model probers) share the same language model:
	///     Win1255Model.
	///     The first nsSBCharSetProber uses the model normally as any other
	///     nsSBCharSetProber does, to recognize windows-1255, upon which this model was
	///     built. The second nsSBCharSetProber is told to make the pair-of-letter
	///     lookup in the language model backwards. This in practice exactly simulates
	///     a visual Hebrew model using the windows-1255 logical Hebrew model.
	///     The nsHebrewProber is not using any language model. All it does is look for
	///     final-letter evidence suggesting the text is either logical Hebrew or visual
	///     Hebrew. Disjointed from the model probers, the results of the nsHebrewProber
	///     alone are meaningless. nsHebrewProber always returns 0.00 as confidence
	///     since it never identifies a charset by itself. Instead, the pointer to the
	///     nsHebrewProber is passed to the model probers as a helper "Name Prober".
	///     When the Group prober receives a positive identification from any prober,
	///     it asks for the name of the charset identified. If the prober queried is a
	///     Hebrew model prober, the model prober forwards the call to the
	///     nsHebrewProber to make the final decision. In the nsHebrewProber, the
	///     decision is made according to the final-letters scores maintained and Both
	///     model probers scores. The answer is returned in the form of the name of the
	///     charset identified, either "windows-1255" or "ISO-8859-8".
